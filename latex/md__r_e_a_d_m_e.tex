Leightweight, header-\/only C++ concurrency library

\section*{Using Concurrent\-D\-X}

Concurrent\-D\-X is a header-\/only library. It relies on some C++ 11 features, however. You will need\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A (mostly) C++11 standard-\/compliant C++ compiler (M\-S\-V\-C10 and later works)
\item A copy of this repo
\item To do the following with your project (where the include paths have been set up to point to whatever directory holds the repo)\-:
\end{DoxyItemize}

```c++ \#include $<$\hyperlink{_concurrent_d_x_8h_source}{Concurrent\-D\-X/\-Concurrent\-D\-X.\-h}$>$ ```
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ...and that's it! All of the classes and containers are in the D\-X\{\} namespace
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Documentation}

Documentation can be found \href{/html/index.html}{\tt here}. The best way to view the documentation is to clone the repo and open up the html off the disk.
